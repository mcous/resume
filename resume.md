I'm an experienced, detail-oriented software engineer who's passionate about
open-source, shipping high-quality experiences, and building things that make
people think, "Hey, that's pretty cool."

I use (or have used) the following tools and techniques, and will happily talk
about any of them:

- **Lanuguages** - TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Scala, embedded C/C++
- **Testing** - Test-driven development, effective mocking, GitHub Actions, API
  integration tests
- **Front-end** - [React], React Hooks, [Redux], bundlers, Web Workers,
  WebSockets, SVG
- **Back-end** - [FastAPI], [Asyncio], Elasticsearch, Redis, AWS, Docker, NGINX
- **Hardware** - AVR 8-bit, ARM Cortex, ZigBee, KiCad, PCB assembly, SolidWorks
